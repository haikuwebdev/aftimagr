Aftimagr
========

This plugin is a generator for getting server-side image management to work
with the TinyMCE editor. It generates a TinyMCE plugin, a Rails controller,
Rails views, and resource routes. Hopefully it "just works" but it's designed
along the lines of Rails' built-in scaffold generator. It gives you bare-bones
generated files with the expectation that you'll make changes to fit your
needs. The generator makes as few assumptions as possible about application
logic.

Dependencies
============

* Rails 2.1.
  
* Prototype Javascript library (comes with Rails)

* TinyMCE (http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/). I've only tested this with 3.x
  versions of TinyMCE.

* attachment_fu plugin (http://github.com/technoweenie/attachment_fu/).

* responds_to_parent plugin 
  (http://github.com/haikuwebdev/responds_to_parent/tree/master)
  This is a fork of the official responds_to_parent repository with some
  changes.
  
Example
=======

script/generate aftimagr attachment_fu_model_name

The attachment_fu_model_name should be singular, but the generated files and
directories will be pluralized. For example:

script/generate aftimagr image

creates an ImagesController, app/views/images directory, etc. At this time, 
there is no option for producing singular names, so you'll just have to edit 
them. (Sorry - I'd likely add this if asked.)

Optional Parameters
===================

--with-editable-image

This parameter will generate code for integrating with the editable-image gem.
The editable-image gem must be installed and configured in your app. See
http://github.com/haikuwebdev/editable-image/ for info.

Once you've run aftimagr with this option, you will need to edit the 
picnik_params method created in the generated controller. If you have more than
one controller with a picnik_params method, you'll probably want to refactor 
that.

--skip-model

Will not generate a model.

--skip-migration

Will not generate a migration.

--with-categories

Generates a separate ActiveRecord model for categories named
#{model_name}Category, the migration for it, and associates it to the model. If
used in conjunction with --skip-model, you will need to create the association
in the attachment_fu model.

What You Do
===========

* You should have an attachment_fu-based model for dealing with images in
  place. At this point the generator does not create that for you, but I'll
  probably make that an option soon. The model should be an attachment_fu based
  model and must provide a class method named thumbnails. (Technically the
  model could be implemented after the generator is run.) The alternative to 
  providing a thumbnails method is to change all the @thumbnails stuff in the
  generated code.

* TinyMCE v3 must be installed at the default location in your Rails app:
  RAILS_ROOT/public/javascripts/tinymce

* I like to have a public/javascripts/tiny_mce_init.js and include it via
  javascript_include_tag in my application.html.erb but this is not mandatory.
  As long as your tinyMCE.init has what it needs, it's all good. Example 
  javascript includes:
  
  <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/tiny_mce', 'tiny_mce_init' %>

* The generator doesn't touch your tinyMCE.init, so you've gotta do that. Your 
  tinyMCE.init must pull in your plugin and its button to launch the dialog 
  window. It must also set the convert_urls and relative_urls options to
  false. Refer to the TinyMCE docs for more info, but here's an example 
  assuming the attachment_fu model is ArticleImage and we've run 
  `script/generate aftimagr article_image`

  tinyMCE.init({
  	mode: "textareas",
  	theme: "advanced",
    plugins: "article_image",
  	theme_advanced_buttons1: "bold,italic,link,unlink,bullist,numlist,code,separator,article_image",
  	theme_advanced_buttons2: "",
  	theme_advanced_buttons3: "",
  	theme_advanced_toolbar_location : "top",
  	theme_advanced_toolbar_align : "left",
  	convert_urls: false,
  	relative_urls: false
  });
  
* You may want to edit the TinyMCE button image for generated TinyMCE plugins,
  especially if you run the generator more than once, thereby making more than
  one TinyMCE plugin. To change this button, replace the gif file in
  your_tiny_mce_plugin_dir/img/your_tiny_mce_plugin.gif
